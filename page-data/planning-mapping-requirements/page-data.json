As with anything, you will become more familiar with Kentico functionality and how to use it over time, but where should you start? Thankfully, there are many resources available to you. We recommend starting with the below:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Attend&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kentico.com/services/training\">Kentico training</a>&nbsp;(both e-learning and instructor-led are available)</li>\n  <li>Read the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/\">Kentico documentation</a></li>\n  <li>Search&nbsp;<a href=\"https://devnet.kentico.com/\">Kentico devnet</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kentico\">Kentico stackoverflow</a></li>\n  <li>Watch videos on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/Kentico/\">Kentico YouTube</a>&nbsp;channel</li>\n  <li>Contact&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kentico.com/services/technical-support\">Kentico support</a>&nbsp;(for general questions or problems regarding the core platform)</li>\n  <li>Work with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kentico.com/services/consulting/overview\">Kentico consulting</a>&nbsp;(for questions or problems regarding customization)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Evaluate built-in functionality</h2>\n<p>Once you narrow it down to a feature you think is suitable for your purpose, it is a good idea to evaluate it more thoroughly through a proof of concept. Doing a proof of concept validates whether or not all the functional requirements can be achieved.<br>\nIf you find that the selected feature meets most but not all of your functional requirements, consider whether you can extend the feature to meet all requirements.</p>\n<h2>Extend built-in functionality</h2>\n<p>If you find that you need to extend Kentico to meet some functional requirement, you need to do three things:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Make sure that you've checked the resources mentioned at the beginning of this section for other features that might accomplish what you need to do. This avoids creating a solution to an already solved problem.</li>\n  <li>Research the available extensibility options&nbsp;of built-in functionality, being conscious of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/custom-development/best-practices-for-customization\">customization best practices</a>&nbsp;in Kentico documentation.</li>\n  <li>Compare extending Kentico functionality versus building something completely custom. When doing the comparison, consider the viability of one versus the other with regard to the effort (in time and cost), the ease of use from a business or other end user's perspective, and the technical complexity.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Build custom functionality</h2>\n<p>If you find that there is no suitable Kentico feature that meets your needs, or you determine that extending Kentico is not a viable option, do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Architect the solution with low maintenance in mind by using as much built-in functionality as possible.</li>\n  <li>Design the solution to be extensible and scale-able for the future.</li>\n  <li>Investigate how other built-in functionality influences the solution (e.g., content staging, web farm, workflow).</li>\n</ul>","images":[],"links":[],"modular_content":[]},"overview":{"value":"<p>Take business requirements and identify the suitable Kentico features and functionalities.</p>"},"teaser":{"value":"<p>When analyzing the functional requirements, we recommend the following approach for mapping requirements to features and functionality in Kentico.
